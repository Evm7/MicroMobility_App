# Micro Mobility Android Application
Application for the correct visualitzation of my Project Degree: Artificial Intelligence applied to Micro Vehicles

## Work stil in progress ‚è≥ :

- [x] Camera video
- [x] Localitzation
- [x] Map integration
- [x] Profile videos
- [x] Home Fragment
- [x] Previsiualtzation of all videos Activity
- [x] Creation of own manual detector
- [x] Integration with the Full System Automatic Own detector
- [ ] Imrpovement of the UI Design




## Goal:

The project consists of a computer vision analysis of the conditions of the circulation of micromobility vehicles (bicycles and personal mobility vehicles or VMPs). This analysis is used to determine the conditions of the road, the presence of static or dynamic obstacles that could pose a danger to the drivers of these vehicles or to pedestrians.
In order to do so, we have already created a project in Python, which contains all the Computer Vision Algorithms. In order to make the project more visual, I have considered the creation of this Android Application as a solution

## Usage:

We make usage of some interesting libraries that we have though were necesary for the app development
```
implementation 'com.ramotion.foldingcell:folding-cell:1.2.3'
implementation 'com.jakewharton.timber:timber:4.7.1'
implementation 'com.mapbox.mapboxsdk:mapbox-android-sdk:9.1.0'
implementation 'com.jakewharton:butterknife:10.0.0' 
 ```
